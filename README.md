# Restaurant Recommendation System

I have created a database system whose sole purpose is to recommend best restaurants in California.

1. The database system is created upon multiple parameters like Restaurant name, Address, Contact, Location, Foursquare ratings and TripAdvisor ratings 
2. Created an AWS RDS database instance for PostgreSQL for restaurant data storage and linked my database server with Dbeaver tool for data querying
3. Scraped restaurant data from yellowpages.com using BeautifulSoup library in Python and received 800+ records worth of structured data
4. Cleaned the scraped data using Pandas library in Python, reformatted the data as per database structure and eliminated redundant work by code optimization
5. Modeled a relational data model in E/R Studio Data Architect for the Restaurant Recommedation System and established meaningful relationships
6. Created tables in Dbeaver and loaded clean data using Psycopg2 library in correspondence to the data model, received 0 load failures and answered business quesitons
7. Successfully extracted restaurant recommendation data from Dbeaver and imported into Microsoft Power BI for data visualization and analysis, resulting in effective representation and illustration of insights
 


# Wollaston's Store Database project

I have created a project on Wollaston's Store Database where I have picked random data of my own discretion. I created the table using CREATE statement and have created 5 new columns respectively. 

Then, I have inserted 15 rows pertaining to various aisles, items, their prices, quantities etc., using INSERT statements. 

Finally, I asked myself two questions and answered them.
1. How many items are there in each Aisle?
2. How do I get all items and navigate which is cheap to expensive per Aisle?


# NASA Astronauts - A Data Mining project

I have created my first data mining project where I used pre-existing dataset from another source for Astronaut details. Citation is provided in my code. I used unique SELECT statements to answer some of the questions posed. They are:

1. What are average, max, and min values in the data?
2. What about the numbers per category in the data?
3. What ways are there to group the data values that don’t exist yet?
4. What interesting ways are there to filter the data?


# Human Resources Officer

I have programmed and developed a GUI window-based application using Java in NetBeans IDE.
Curated a UI that facilitates Human Resource processes like creating, reading, updating and deleting employees’ records and other 
confidential data.
