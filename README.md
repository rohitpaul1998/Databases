# Wollaston's Store Database project

I have created a project on Wollaston's Store Database where I have picked random data of my own discretion. I created the table using CREATE statement and have created 5 new columns respectively. 

Then, I have inserted 15 rows pertaining to various aisles, items, their prices, quantities etc., using INSERT statements. 

Finally, I asked myself two questions and answered them.
1. How many items are there in each Aisle?
2. How do I get all items and navigate which is cheap to expensive per Aisle?


# NASA Astronauts - A Data Mining project

I have created my first data mining project where I used pre-existing dataset from another source for Astronaut details. Citation is provided in my code. I used unique SELECT statements to answer some of the questions posed. They are:

1. What are average, max, and min values in the data?
2. What about the numbers per category in the data?
3. What ways are there to group the data values that don’t exist yet?
4. What interesting ways are there to filter the data?
