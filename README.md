# Introduction

Hello! I am Rohit Paul Gerard Nagarajan, a graduate student at Northeastern University, Boston. I am majoring in Information Systems. This repository is a collection of all my projects related to Database Management, Data Architecture and much more.


# Wollaston's Store Database

I have created a project on Wollaston's Store Database where I have picked random data of my own discretion. I created the table using CREATE statement and have created 5 new columns respectively. 

Then, I have inserted 15 rows pertaining to various aisles, items, their prices, quantities etc., using INSERT statements. 

Finally, I asked myself two simple-straightforward questions.
1. How many items are there in each Aisle?
2. How do I get all items and navigate which is cheap to expensive per Aisle?


# Conclusion

I am satisfied with the result of my code and I am hoping to increase the scope of my upcoming projects as I hoping to gain skills in Web Scraping, Data Munging, Data cleaning, Data Analysis etc. Stay tuned for more!
